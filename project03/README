This is an introductory application made during CSCI 446 (Web applications) at the Colorado School of Mines during Spring 2012.
This depot application allows users to create orders using the items in the store and see their cart fill up and empty as needed.
Totals are displayed for users and allows admins to track what orders have been placed and who needs to ship things.
There is also the ability to add administrator accounts to modify different aspects of the Model.
